Late last year, his company launched MekaMon â€“ the world\'s first augmented reality gaming robot that lets players obsessively battle in both the physical and virtual world.The MekaMon robots (which sell for $279/N100,000) are made of plastic and are controlled using a smartphone app, which creates a virtual world for users to battle in and explore. The app is also used to upgrade the robots with new abilities.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a two-player mode, where you can simply battle another MekaMon in real life. The robots can even be customized with different snap-on components like weapons and shields to improve their capabilities. Reach Robotics, the innovative company behind this groundbreaking invention, was founded about 4 years ago by the Nigeria-born engineer while he was studying at Bristol Robotics Lab.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with Wired about what inspired him to start Reach Robotics and create MekaMon, Silas said:\r\n\r\n    &quot;There is nothing more immersive than the world around us, and being able to bridge this gap provides a richer entertainment experience\r\n\r\n    Consumer robotics is also a great way to get young people into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).

But Oshiorenoya Agabi believes that these processors are missing one major component in that evolution: actual human brains. With his startup Koniku, Agabi is working on fusing lab-grown biological neurons onto computer chips in hopes of improving the current state of artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nRather than building chips that simply mimic the brain function of humans, Agabi hopes go directly to the source and borrow the actual material of the human brains to create these chips â€“ in an effort to make them more powerful than their standard silicon predecessors. Speaking with Rising Africa about his progress, Agabi said:\r\n\r\n    \'Essentially, for the last fifteen years, I have worked to understand how neurons talk to each other. I\'ve worked on how to communicate with individual neurons â€“ how to read information from them and write information into them.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo, through years of teaching machines to learn, and through the study of the brain\'s mechanics, Agabi believes that his team will be able to build a computer chip with living, learning processors.\r\n\r\nLater this year, Agabi will be one of the African speakers who will grace the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.', 'konbini', 'http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/oshiorenoya-agabi-is-building-a-computer-made-of-human-brains/', 0, 12, '2017/7/31/1/211', '08:23:00', 2),

Customers had a hard time paying online, and businesses still had to do a lot of work to accept these payments.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Sola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi decided to do something about it. They built Paystack, a platform that helps Nigerian - and African - businesses accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world - through debit, credit cards, and direct bank debits. They built Paystack as a result of personal need - they were entrepreneurs working on their respective businesses which, as it turns out, were facing online payment challenges. With their platform, all businesses now have to do is connect Paystack to their websites and start receiving online payments in as little as 30 minutes! Paystack is not just helping existing businesses accept payments, it is also allowing new businesses to get started, get paid and grow their businesses - and allowing customers feel safer about revealing their card information - in way less time than it used to take in the past.\r\n\r\nSince the official launch in January 2016, Paystack has grown steadily and currently serves over 2,000 merchants in Nigeria and went from processing N500,000 at launch to processing over N600 million in April 2017. Paystack is now in early talks to expand to Ghana and Kenya. Speaking to Konbini about the company\'s future plans, Paystack CEO, Sola, said:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Despite the progress we have made, there is a lot of room for improvement. We have the unbanked, the financially excluded who are yet to experience the convenience of online payments. We aim to change the way everyone (merchants and their paying customers) interact with money and create a sort of financial personal assistant embedded into their daily lives to make it easier.&quot;\r\n\r\nPreviously, Sola developed software projects for banks and worked on Precurio, a document management software, which has gone on to be interpreted in 6 languages and has had over 200,000 downloads; while Ezra worked with online job portal, Jobberman and later on, Delivery Science.\r\n\r\nThe team has expanded to include 10 more people; and Paystack is not slowing down. They believe that there\'s still room for improvement in the payments sector, and they plan to continue to build capacity to tend to the pain points of Nigerians - and Africans.', 'konbini', 'http://www.konbini.com/ng/partners/sola-akinlade-ezra-olubi-revolutionizing-online-payments-africa/', 0, 12, '2017/7/31/1/211', '08:27:47', 3),

However, Sanni said in gross violation of his legal right as the duly elected candidate of the party, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) unlawfully substituted his name with that of Masha as the candidate of the party for the election based on a false withdrawal letter caused to be written by Banire in his capacity as National Legal Adviser to INEC.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDissatisfied with the development, Sanni approached the Federal High Court in Lagos and in a judgment in suit with reference number FHC/L/CS/34/2015, Justice Mohammed Buba upheld the reliefs sought and ordered his reinstatement as the lawful candidate of the APC. Sanni said ever since Banire unlawfully substituted his name and caused a purported withdrawal letter to be written, the party was yet to set any machinery in motion for him to explain or justify why the letter was written, adding that by the development, Banire had betrayed the confidence reposed in him as the National Legal Adviser and his standing as a legal practitioner, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and a bencher.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBesides, Sanni accused Banire of involving in series of anti-party activities and breach of several provisions of APC Constitution such as Article 21 (a) (ii), Article 21 (a) (v), Article 21 (a) (v), among others. For instance, the Deputy Speaker recalled the unauthorized publicity of the partyâ€™s dispute in Lagos State which Banire made in the Punch of July 1, 2017 and Premium Times of July 10, 2017 respectively without reference to APC Lagos State Congress or the national executive committee, as well as exhausting all avenues within the party hierarchy in the State or the national level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe also said that Banire, in breach of Article 21 (a) (x) of the partyâ€™s Constitution, filed an action in court against the Chairman and other principal officers of the APC in Lagos State without first exhausting all avenues provided for in the Constitution of the party. Based on the foregoing, Sanni is asking the court for a declaration that having breached the established legal principles but not limited to the provisions of the APC Constitution (2014), Banire be removed as National Legal Adviser and a declaration that he is entitled to be expelled from the party or vacate office with immediate effect in accordance with Section 21 (d) (v) for the suit he instituted against the state chapter concerning the conduct of primaries for Local Government election and denouncing the entire process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the alternative, Sanni is asking that having regard to the provisions of APC Constitution including but not limited to the fact that the defendant had been engaging in anti-party activities likely to cause a breach of peace amongst the party members, an order should be issued by the court mandating the APC leadership to take appropriate disciplinary measures against Banire.', 'linda ikeji\'s blog', 'http://www.lindaikejisblog.com/2017/7/lagos-state-deputy-speaker-sues-former-commissioner-muiz-banire.html', 0, 10, '2017/7/31/1/211', '18:57:57', 5),

He noted that the partnership would provide a platform for agricultural bodies to work together and exploit opportunities within the agricultural value chain. â€œBetween 2011 and 2016, GrowAfrica has been able to mobilise over 200 companies from global and domestic companies in Africa to pledge nearly 10 billion dollars worth of investments in agriculture. â€œThese were pledges made by these companies to invest in agriculture with commitment from government on agreements with farmers and civil society and many others in the value chain,â€ he said. â€œWe are launching this partnership to transform the economy by engaging different actors in the value chain to evolve business scale of investments.â€ On his part, Ijewere said one of the effective ways of ensuring the success of the partnership was to involve the grassroots in developing agricultural policies. â€œThis will create a relationship that builds from the ground to the top, thereby carrying the farmers along in decision making.â€ Meanwhile, Mrs Gloria Akobundu, the CEO of the New Partnership for Africaâ€™s Development (NEPAD), lauded the partnership, saying it will help to attract more youths to agriculture. Akobundu, who was represented by the Director of Programmes Development and Implementation in NEPAD, Mr Folayan Ayodele, said following the depletion of the number of farmers because of age, there was need to encourage youths to return to the farms. â€œIt will help to stem the rural-urban drift and the private sector can play a significant role in making agriculture more attractive by helping youths to see agriculture as a business for wealth creation and empowerment, â€ she said.

Brent crude futures were $52.90 per barrel earlier in the day, their highest since May 25, according to online portal, Premium Times. U.S. West Texas Intermediate, WTI, futures were up 16 cents or 0.3per cent at $49.87 per barrel. The entire WTI curve is close to moving back over $50 per barrel, with only September and October a notch below that level. The price rise put both crude benchmarks on track for a sixth consecutive session of gains. Prices have risen around 10 per cent since the last meeting of leading members by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, and other major producers, including Russia. At that instance, the group discussed potential measures to further tighten oil markets. â€œU.S inventories are showing massive drawdown, Saudi Arabia seems intent on playing its role as the worldâ€™s swing producer. â€œImpending sanctions on Venezuela by the U.S will almost certainly be oil price-supportive,â€ said Jeffrey Halley, analyst at futures brokerage, OANDA. The U.S is considering imposing sanctions on Venezuelaâ€™s vital oil sector in response to Sundayâ€™s election of a constitutional super-body that Washington has denounced as a â€œshamâ€ vote. However, traders said the biggest price supporter was currently a tightening U.S oil market. â€œStrong increases in the price of oil â€¦ (were) fuelled in large part by the substantial drawdowns in U.S. inventories over the past several weeks,â€ said William Oâ€™Loughlin, analyst at Rivkin Securities. â€œA continuation of this trend could indicate the oil market is rebalancing thanks to the production cuts by OPEC and Russia,â€ he added. After rising by more than 10 per cent since mid-2016, U.S oil production dipped by 0.2 per cent to 9.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week to July 21. Drilling for new U.S. production is also slowing, with just 10 rigs added in July, the fewest since May 2016. The tighter market was also visible in the price curve, which shows backwardation in the front end. Backwardation is a market condition in which prices for immediate delivery of a product are higher than those later on.', 'vanguardngr', 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/oil-price-hits-two-months-high-53-per-barrel-2/', 0, 4, '2017/8/6/0/217', '19:58:22', 30),
